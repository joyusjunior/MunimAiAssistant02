‚úÖ 2. Flaws & Feedback for the Prototype Chatbot
üîó Prototype link

Here‚Äôs what Munim AI needs to improve:

üü† A. Get User Inputs (Missing or Incomplete):
It should ask the user for all mandatory invoice fields, especially:

Buyer GSTIN

Place of supply (important for deciding IGST or SGST/CGST)

HSN/SAC code

Quantity & Rate for line items

GST rate selection

‚úÖ Suggestion: Use a sequential Q&A flow or form to collect these details before generating the invoice. Don't assume fixed values.

‚ùå 3. Download Option Not Working
Your current prototype has a non-functional ‚ÄúDownload‚Äù button ‚Äî clicking it doesn‚Äôt download the invoice.

‚úÖ Fix Suggestion:
Ensure that the invoice is converted to a PDF format before download.

Use a library like jsPDF or html2pdf in the frontend to export HTML as PDF.

For backend-generated invoices, set correct headers:

http
Copy
Edit
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="invoice.pdf"
Content-Type: application/pdf
‚úÖ What to Say to the Chatbot Developers:
You can relay this short message to the dev team:

Message to Devs:

The chatbot is working decently but needs to collect more user input to generate proper invoices. It must ask for GSTIN, place of supply, HSN/SAC, quantity, rate, and GST % at a minimum. Also, the download feature is broken‚Äîplease ensure the invoice is generated as a downloadable PDF, either via frontend tools (like jsPDF) or backend with correct headers.
